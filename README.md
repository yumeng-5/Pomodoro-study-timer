# Pomodoro Timer GUI Application
A simple graphical Pomodoro timer built using Python's built-in `tkinter` library to help you manage work and break intervals effectively.

## Description
This application provides a visual timer based on the Pomodoro Technique. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. After a set number of work intervals, a longer break is taken. This application automates the cycle of work, short breaks, and long breaks to help improve focus and prevent burnout.

## Features
* **Visual Timer:** Displays the remaining time on a background image.
* **Status Indicator:** A label at the top clearly indicates whether it's currently "Work" or "Break" time, with corresponding color changes.
* **Session Tracking:** Displays checkmarks ("âœ”") for each completed work interval.
* **Simple Controls:** Easy-to-use "Start" and "Reset" buttons.
* **Customizable:** Work/break durations and color themes can be easily modified in the code constants.
